# RCML Community Rules

# About RCML

*RCML* is an intellectual management system and high level programming language for industrial robotics.

*RCML* commercial software allows to create adaptive cells and production lines with industrial robots and reduces the cost of their programming and changeover up to 10 times.

*RCML* is an official partner of largest manufacturers of industrial robots in the world: [ABB (Switzerland)](http://new.abb.com/products/robotics), [FANUC (Japan)](http://www.fanuc.com/), [KUKA (Germany)](https://www.kuka.com/).

*RCML* open source projects are the modules of the *RCML* language that might be used by service robots or in communication between robots.

We want you to join us in development of the ways of robotic communication. 

Please read the following Readme and [Contribution.md]() before you start.

# Repositories available for editing

## Robots

 - ["Lego NXT Robot Module"](https://github.com/rcml-tech/lego_nxt_robot_module)
 
	*Lego Mindstorms NXT* is the second generation of the *Lego kit*.
	
	The module of the *lego_nxt* robot is used for connecting *Lego NXT* units to RCML. 

 - ["Lego EV3 Robot Module"](https://github.com/rcml-tech/lego_ev3_robot_module)
 
	*Lego Mindstorms Ev3* is the third generation of the *Lego kit*.
 	
	The module of the *lego_ev3* robot is used for connecting *Lego Ev3* units to RCML. 
 
 - ["uArm Robot Module"](https://github.com/rcml-tech/lego_ev3_robot_module)
 
	[*uArm*](http://www.ufactory.cc/#/en/) is a 4-axis manipulator, a miniature version of the industrial *ABB PalletPack IRB460* robot.
	
	The module of uarm is used for connecting the uArm robot to RCML.
	
## Functional Modules

 - ["Math Function Module"](https://github.com/rcml-tech/math_function_module)
 
	The *math* functional module is used to access mathematical functions similar to those in the math.h library in *C++*.
	
## Manual Control Modules

 - ["Keyboard Control Module"](https://github.com/rcml-tech/keyboard_control_module)
 
	The *keyboard* control module is used to manually control the robot with the use of a keyboard.
 
 - ["Gamepad Control Module"](https://github.com/rcml-tech/gamepad_control_module)
 
	The *gamepad* control module ensures manual robot control with the use of a gamepad.
 
 - ["Myo Control Module"](https://github.com/rcml-tech/myo_control_module)

	[*Myo*](https://www.myo.com/) is an armband that allows using various gestures to control a PC, a smartphone or a tablet.
	
	The *Myo* control module is used for manual control of the robot using the *Myo* device, which detects gestures and position of the hand in space.
	
## Modules of robot choice
	
 - ["AVG Choice Module"](https://github.com/rcml-tech/avg_choice_module)
 
	The robot selection module *avg* implements the simplest logics for choosing the fastest robot based on the *RCML* statistical data.
	
## Communication libraries modules

 - ["ROS Library Module"](https://github.com/rcml-tech/ros_function_module)
 
	[*ROS*](http://www.ros.org/) library module allows to send messages of standard types supported by *ROS* to chosen topics.
	
 - ["Modbus"]()
 
	In development.

 - ["MQTT"]() 
 
	Planned to be developed.
	
# List of Improvements

We are going to grow the list of libraties and interfaces for communication with industrial robots supported by *RCML*.

Cheak actual tasks on [community Trello board](http://trello.com).

Any feedback/contribution is appreciated!
