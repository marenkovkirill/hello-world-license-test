# 1 About RCML software and programming language

*RCML* is an intellectual management system and high level programming language developed for industrial robotics.

*RCML* commercial software  for industiral robotics allows to create adaptive cells and production lines and reduces the cost of their programming and changeover up to 10 times.

*RCML* is an official partner of largest manufacturers of industrial robots in the world: [ABB (Switzerland)](http://new.abb.com/products/robotics), [FANUC (Japan)](http://www.fanuc.com/), [KUKA (Germany)](https://www.kuka.com/).

*RCML* open source projects were developed as parts of the Robot Control Meta Language and modules created to connect
